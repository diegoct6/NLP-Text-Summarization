    "## 1. Goal Description \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following markdown, we explore different summarizing approaches that are available in NLP before chosing a final model for our business application. \n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, there are many methods for text summarization. The most common way of classifying them is according to two basic approaches to the summary, based on their outputs type: extractive ones and abstractive ones. \n",
    "In the extractive summaries, the summary is simply the extraction of the most important sentences which are then joined to get the brief summary. On the other hand, the abstract summary algorithms generate new sentences with the most useful information from the original text (a more human-like approach). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebook, we first take a look at the Extractive Approach to summarization before looking at the Abstractive Approach. We try to develop a simple yet accurate model using the most knowledge we have seen in our class. We base our reasonning on what have already be done in the field and try to improve on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final goal is to be able to build a proper pipeline of clean code that we can use in a Web Application also developped for the matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first start by building a basic pipeline for Extractive Summarizers before building on top of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Datasets and Metrics used\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to compare the evolution of the different models, more than our common sense and reading the text and comparing the outputs, it helps to have a metric benchmark to base our comparison on. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is why we will be using here the ROUGE metric for comparing the output of our model to actual summaries of texts we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 The ROUGE Metric\n",
    "ROUGE, which stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation is basically a set of metrics for evaluating the summarization of texts by various models and could as well be used to assess machine translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it does is comparing the automatically produced summary to a set of reference summaries, which are usually made by humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get a quantitative value, we will compute the precision, recall, and F-measure using the overlap between those 2 texts. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recall** here in the context of ROUGE, tries to assess how much of the reference summary the model summary is capturing. But it is not necessarily telling us everything. The model's summary can be very long, capturing all the words in the reference summary. However, many of the words in the model summary could be useless, which would make our summary unnecessarily verbose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision** is then relevant. What this measures is how much of the model summary is in fact needed or relevant. This measure is important when we are trying to generate summaries that are concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library we use here to compute this metric outputs 3 different granularity of text measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ROUGE-1** which refers to overlap of unigrams between our model summary and the original summary; \n",
    "- **ROUGE-2** which refers to overlap of bigrams between our model summary and the original summary; \n",
    "- **ROUGE-L** which measures the longest matching sequence of words using LCS (which stands for Longest Common Subsequence). The advantage here is that LCS does not require consecutive matches but rather in-sequence matches that actually reflect some sentence level word order. We thus here do not need to specify the n-gram we are looking for.\n",
    "(we used [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-rouge-and-how-it-works-for-evaluation-of-summaries-e059fb8ac840/)'s great explanations).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 The Texts used\n",
    "As mentionned above, in order to assess the performance of our models, we should have some texts and a corresponding human made summary. We actually found a dataset containing over 400 news articles of the BBC from 2004 to 2005. And for each articles, summaries are provided. This dataset can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/pariza/bbc-news-summary). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because our use case focuses on summarizing texts related to business, we chose articles in the business area as well. \n",

    "Call centre users 'lose patience'\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music. The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. \"Customers are getting used to the idea of an 'always available' society,\" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey. However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. One possible reason for the lack in patience, Ms Diemont says, is the fact that more customers are calling 'on the move' using their mobile phones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres' growing range of tasks. \"Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,\" Ms Diemont says. Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, the survey found.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what Dimension Data calls an \"alarming development\", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving \"agents not equipped to deal with customers\". This, Ms Diemont warns, is \"scary\" and not good for the bottom line either. Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. As a result, call centres have a high \"churn rate\", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. Resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer's query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions that \"outsourcing\" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are \"no big differences in wait time and call resolution\" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world. \"You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place,\" she says. However, companies that decide to \"offshore\" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. Only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. They give three key reasons for not making the move:\n",
    "\n",
    "- call centre operations are part of their business \"core function\", \n",
    " - they are worried about the risk of going abroad, \n",
    " - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive. The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents. What are your experiences with call centres? Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves, or do you want an immediate response? And if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job?\n",

    "\n",
    "A judge has dismissed an attempt by Russian oil giant Yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yukos filed for Chapter 11 protection in Houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its Yugansk division by the Russian authorities. The court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of Yugansk, which Yukos claims was illegally sold. Separately, former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky began testimony on Friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Khodorkovsky - who has been in jail for more than a year - pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities. \"I pride myself on heading for 15 years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees,\" he told a Russian court.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yugansk was auctioned to help pay off $27.5bn (¬£14.5bn) in unpaid taxes. It was bought for $9.4bn by a previously-unknown group, which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company Rosneft.\n",
    "\n",
    "Texas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a US presence to establish US jurisdiction. \"The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia,\" Judge Clark said in her ruling. \"Such activities require the continued participation of the Russian government.\" Yukos had argued that a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in Houston. Yukos claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts.\n",

    "\n",
    "Less than four years after the new Mini was launched, German car maker BMW has announced ¬£100m of new investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some 200 new jobs are to be created at the Oxford factory, including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. The result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007. The rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. Before Wednesday's announcement, BMW had invested some ¬£280m in Mini production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since its launch during summer 2001, the new Mini has gone from strength to strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini. The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. \"Our decision to produce a new Mini was not received well right away,\" said Norbert Reithofer, a member of the BMW management board. Initially, BMW said it would produce 100,000 Mini models a year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. \"The risk is that after they've invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new VW Beetle,\" said Brad Wernle, from Automotive News Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The price of the car has also gone up. When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than ¬£10,000. These days, buyers will have to fork out almost ¬£11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to ¬£17,730. The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to ¬£15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. Second-hand Minis are not cheap either. A Mini One bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least ¬£8,000 for the cheapest model, while a used Cooper S is likely to be priced from ¬£12,556, according to the-car buying website Parker's. The consumers' association Which operates with slightly different numbers, yet it confirms that the Mini Cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car, other than the Mercedes Benz C180 SE and the BMW 1 Series 116i SE.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cowley factory, which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100,000 Minis, is increasingly being put to good use.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. BMW's Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for ¬£10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium. In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory was producing the award-winning Rover 75. During that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. Last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 Mini-workers. The Mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars. Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge. Indeed, Mini is not only producing more cars than MG Rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of Land Rovers and Range Rovers (which are made by the former Rover unit that BMW sold to Ford) are taken into account.\n",

      "In what Dimension Data calls an \"alarming development\", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving \"agents not equipped to deal with customers\".\n",
      "As a result, call centres have a high \"churn rate\", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff.\n",

      " Call centre users 'lose patience'Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.Once past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music. The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. \"Customers are getting used to the idea of an 'always available' society,\" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey. However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. One possible reason for the lack in patience, Ms Diemont says, is the fact that more customers are calling 'on the move' using their mobile phones.The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres' growing range of tasks. \"Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,\" Ms Diemont says. Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, the survey found.In what Dimension Data calls an \"alarming development\", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving \"agents not equipped to deal with customers\". This, Ms Diemont warns, is \"scary\" and not good for the bottom line either. Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. As a result, call centres have a high \"churn rate\", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. Resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer's query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate.Suggestions that \"outsourcing\" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.There are \"no big differences in wait time and call resolution\" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world. \"You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place,\" she says. However, companies that decide to \"offshore\" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. Only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. They give three key reasons for not making the move:- call centre operations are part of their business \"core function\",  - they are worried about the risk of going abroad,  - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive. The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents. What are your experiences with call centres? Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves, or do you want an immediate response? And if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job?\n"

    "The firm's revenue nearly tripled in the fourth quarter of 2004, exceeding $86m (¬£46m). Ask Jeeves, once among the best-known names on the web, is now a relatively modest player. Its $17m profit for the quarter was dwarfed by the $204m announced by rival Google earlier in the week. During the same quarter, Yahoo earned $187m, again tipping a resurgence in online advertising.\n",

    "The trend has taken hold relatively quickly. Late last year, marketing company Doubleclick, one of the leading providers of online advertising, warned that some or all of its business would have to be put up for sale. But on Thursday, it announced that a sharp turnaround had brought about an unexpected increase in profits. Neither Ask Jeeves nor Doubleclick thrilled investors with their profit news, however. In both cases, their shares fell by some 4%. Analysts attributed the falls to excessive expectations in some quarters, fuelled by the dramatic outperformance of Google on Tuesday.'''\n",

    "First shown as a concept car at the 2003 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, the V8 Vantage will be available in the UK in late summer. Development costs for the Vantage have been kept low by sharing a platform with Aston's DB9, which Mr Bez described as \"the previous most important car for our company\". There is currently an 18 months waiting list for the DB9, Mr Bez said.

    "## 5. Explanation of the final model chosen for the application\n",
    "\n",
    "To briefly summarize our work, here are the models we have considered and built on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model 1 basic summarizer: this model assigned a score to each sentence according to the words in the frequency table;\n",
    "2. Model 2 TF-IDF approach: this model did not consider the words frequency alone but computed the product of the term frequency and the inverse document frequency;\n",
    "3. Model 3 Cosine Similarity: this model is based on cosine similarities between the sentences, and instead of considering the magnitude, the cosine similarities consider rather the orientation;\n",
    "4. TextRank Algorithm: this model is based on a graph generated from a cosine similarity matrix built using sentence embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to compare the performance of our extractor summarizers, we run the T5 Abstractive summarizer to see if our approach was solid.\n",
    "\n",
    "We ended up approving on the TextRank model due to the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model is an easy one to build which offered a better performance than Models 1,2,3 in terms of the ROUGE metric;\n",
    "- When compared to the other models, this model offered a better readability when it comes to the output;\n",
    "- It takes into account semantically similar words by using the embeddings approach;\n",
    "- It is able to scale to big texts and not only give a brief summary. As noted above, the T5 abstractive model is  limited in terms of the length of the output. When we tried it with a lenghty text, it summarized it accurately in just 2-3 sentences but did not give more than 70 words. This could be an advantage when we have short texts; but when talking about lengthy business cases we believe a 10-20 sentences summary would be better, which is what our model has been able to accurately give us;\n",
    "- As also explained, abstractive summarizers are harder to build and require an advanced understanding of Neural Networks. Even implementing a pre-trained model like the T5 took a long time to set up and download.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all those reasons and knowing we wanted to implement our model into a Web Application, the choice of the TextRank algorithm seemed the most appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model that we will use in the deployed Web Application will thus be the following one:"
